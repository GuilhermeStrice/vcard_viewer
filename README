# vCard Parser & Generator

A simple, web-based tool for parsing and generating vCard (`.vcf`) files. Built as a test using **Jules by Google**, this project demonstrates how structured contact information can be read and written using an intuitive browser interface.

This application allows users to upload `.vcf` (vCard) files to extract contact information or to generate new vCards by entering contact details manually. It's designed to work entirely client-side with no back-end server, ensuring data stays private and local to the browser.
